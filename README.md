This is a sample app written in Kotlin following clean architecture principles which displays 
a list of sorted currecies with respect to Australian Dollar

The purpose of this app to showcase:
- Implementation of Jetpack Compose, Android Architecture components with Dagger Hilt.
  Note: Jetpack Compose is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. 
- Performing network call with KTOR client and Kotlin Coroutines
- A demonstration of ProduceState with compose. 
  Note: ProduceState launches a coroutine scoped to the Composition that can push values into a returned State.
